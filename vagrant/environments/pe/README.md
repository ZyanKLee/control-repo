# Vagrant environment based on Puppet Enterprise

In this Vagrant environment machines are provisioned with Puppet Enterprise, thanks to the wonderful [pe_build](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-pe_build) plugin.

By default you have at disposal the ```puppet``` machine, who has a PE allinone installation, and other VMs for other roles, which use puppet agent on the puppet VM (which compiles catalogs based on code and data on this control-repo).

Edit ```config.yaml``` in this directory to customise the VMs to test, the Puppet Enterprise version to use and how you want your Vagrant environment to be.

To work in this Vagrant environment:

    # You need the pe_build plugin
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-pe_build

    cd <your-control-repo-dir>
    cd vagrant/environment/pe

    # Show available Vagrant machines
    vagrant status

    # Customise them, eventually updating the PE version to use
    vi config.yaml

    # Start the puppet. It will download PE tarball, install it and run puppet agent 
    vagrant up puppet
    vagrant reload puppet   # In case of errors. See Note 1
    vagrant provison puppet # See Note 1

    # Then start the other VM you want to test.
    # They will run puppet agent pointing to the puppet vm
    vagrant up [vm]               # See Note 2


Note 1: The first time a new PE tarball is downloaded from the net you may have an error as what follows, when provisioning the puppet:

    bash: line 2: /vagrant/.pe_build/puppet-enterprise-2016.2.1-el-7-x86_64/puppet-enterprise-installer: No such file or directory

It looks like the newly downloaded PE tarball, placed in the ```.pe_build``` directory of this Vagrant environment, is not immediately available on the VM under its ```/vagrant``` directory.

If the PE installation files are already in place when you vagrant up the puppet, you won't have this error, so the quick solution is (the very first time you use a new PE version):

    vagrant up puppet # It fails if ```.pe_build``` doesn't contain the installation files for your PE version
    vagrant reload puppet # Machines reloads and this times mounts ```/vagrant``` with all the expected files
    vagrant provision puppet # Do the real provisioning: it should install PE and run puppet agent with no errors


Note 2: It's recommended to run this Vagrant environment on hosts that have at least 16 Gb or RAM. Edit ```config.yaml``` to tune the memory to allocate to the VM.

To access the PE console from your host browse to **https://127.0.0.1:1443**

Login: **admin**
Password: **puppetlabs**

#### Gitlab integration

This environments also provides a fairly evoluted integration with GitLab:

  - The VM git is provisioned with an all-in-one installation of Gitlab. To access it, once the machine is provisioned, browse to **https://localhost:1444** (use a hostname different that the one used for PE to avoid certs errors on your browser when trying to reach two different sites, with different, self signed, certs, for the same hostname) errors on your browser when trying to reach two different sites, with different, self signed, certs, for the same hostname).
    You have to make your first login and create your user.

  - The VM cirunner is provisioned with GitLab runner and the tools needed to run the automated tests defined in the ```.gitlab-ci.yml``` file of this project.

You can setup, more or less manually, a fully automated CI with Pipelines on GitLab trigger Puppet code deployments.

In such environments you can configure, via PE console, nodues to run with agent specified environment and then test the code you are currently working on, on your host, directly via the PE Puppet master VM, using the specifal ```host``` environment:

    # Run Puppet agent using the control-repo environment on your host
    agent# puppet agent -t --environment=host

    # Run Puppet using any other branch named environment deployed via Code Manager
    agent# puppet agent -t --environment=$branch
