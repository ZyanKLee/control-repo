# Puppet Enterprise and Gitlab integration

Deep and powerful integrations are possible in this control-repo between Puppet (Enterprise) and GitLab.

Here we review what is done in this control-repo and the manual steps for a fully PE-GitLab integrated environment:

  - Puppet Code Manager integration between GitLab and PE
  - Puppet profiles to configure gitlab and gitlab runners
  - Gitlab CI integration with Puppet controlled via the ```.gitlab-ci.yml``` file.
  - PE based Vagrant environment where to test the full integration

## Puppet Code Manager deployments automation

It's possible to configure PE's Code Manager to automatically deploy code on the Puppet server when any change occurs in a control-repo hosted on GitLab.


### Configure Code Manager

To configure Code Manager integration with GitLab follow [official documentation](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/code_mgr_config.html).

In short, set these keys via Hiera or manually on the PE console on the Puppet Master of Masters node (or the Puppet Master in a AIO setup):

    # Url of the control repo hosted on the internal GitLab server
    puppet_enterprise::profile::master::r10k_remote: git@git.lan:puppet/control-repo.git'

    # Path of a ssh private key able to access the repo. File should be owned by pe-puppet user.
    puppet_enterprise::profile::master::r10k_private_key: '/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa'

    # Enable Code Manager auto deployment
    puppet_enterprise::profile::master::code_manager_auto_configure: true

[Manual] steps needed:

  - Create a new repo for your control-repo on GitLab
  - Create a user for deployments on GitLab (ie: deployer), be sure it can access (at least in read only) your control-repo
  - Create a ssh key pair on the Puppet Server (```ssh-keygen```) and copy the private key under ```/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa``` and be sure ```pe-puppet``` user can read it
  - On GitLab add the relevant public key to the deployer user.
  - On PE Console create a user and assign it to the Code Deployers role (see below for details)
  - On the Puppet Server request an authentication token (see below for details) to use for deployments
  - On GitLab add the created PE token to your project's Webhooks.

The class ```profile::puppet::pe_code_manager``` automates some of the above steps.

### Create a deploy user on PE console

User creation on PE console:

  - Click: Access Control -> Users -> Add local user (Specify Full Name and login)
  - Click: User -> Edit user -> Generate Password reset
  - Copy the link for password reset and open it with a browser to the the user password.
  - To assign a new role to the user click User Roles -> Selected role -> Add user (Select from menu the User name)

Check [here](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/rbac_user_roles.html) for more details on PE user roles.

For Code Manager is enough to assign the created user to the Code Deployers role.

### Request an authentication token

PE allows the usage of tokens to manage access to its APIs. Check [Token Based Authentication(https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/rbac_token_auth.html) for more details.
 
To create a token of a local system user we can use the ```puppet-access``` command. 

It's configuration file is in ```/etc/puppetlabs/client-tools/puppet-access.conf``` a sample command to request an authentication token (which lasts 5 years) is:

    puppet-access login --lifetime 5h

You are asked to introduce a login and a password, use the credentials of the PE user for which you want to create the token (which will have the access privileges of the username used in puppet-access).

Token is stored in ```~/.puppetlabs/token```, to view activities done using the Token, in the PE console, click Access control > Users > Selected user > Details > Activity tab.

To manage tokens default lifetime, on the PE console node (note: the default value is just 5 minutes):

  puppet_enterprise::profile::console::rbac_token_auth_lifetime: 10y

Note: The control repo provides the define ```tools::puppet::access``` to automate Token requests (you need to provide PE username and password).

Tokens used for Code Deployment have to be added in GitLab's project [webhooks](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/code_mgr_webhook.html).


## Puppet profiles for GitLab components

The control repo provides some class and defines to work with GitLab:

  - ```profile::gitlab``` installs GitLab and eventually creates projects, groups and users (WIP)
  - ```profile::gitlab::runner``` installs a GitLab runner (one or more instances)
  - ```profile::gitlab::proxy``` configures Nginx to act as a reverse proxy of a remote GitLab server
  - ```profile::gitlab::cli``` installs GitLab cli and configures its access credentials via a custom ```/etc/gitlab-cli.conf``` file.
  - ```ptofile::gitlab::ci``` creates the ```/etc/gitlab-ci.conf``` used by some scripts in the CI pipeline
  - ```tools::gitlab::runner``` define used to create a GitLab runner instance
  - ```tools::gitlab::user``` define used to create a GitLab user
  - ```tools::gitlab::group``` define used to create a GitLab group
  - ```tools::gitlab::project``` define used to create a GitLab project

## Puppet CI integration on Gitlab

Setup of a fully integrated CI pipeline for Puppet deployments via GitLab is possible using local profiles, tools and scripts.
At the moment this setup is not completely automated, some steps (user creation on PE and GitLab, secrets setting and configuration).


### GitLab Merge Resquests and approvals

In the pipelines you may use the commands ```bin/gitlab_create_merge_request.rb``` and ```bin/gitlab_accept_merge_request.rb``` to automate the remote managements of GitLAB Merge Requests.

These scripts use the ```/etc/gitlab-cli.conf``` file generated by the ```profile::gitlab::cli``` class.

You configure it with something like:

    profile::gitlab::cli::private_token: '9C2xPzg9V22Ha3TdsQpx'  # This changes at every GitLab installationn
    profile::gitlab::cli::api_endpoint: 'https://git.lan/api/v3' # Use the url of your GitLab server
    profile::gitlab::cli::project_id: 3 # ID of the control-repo repo on your GitLab (TODO: be able to specify just the project name)

The GitLab private token is the one from a user that has, on GitLab, the permissions for the requested activities (such as MR management). Create a user with such privileges and then retrive it's Private token from:
User Settings [Settings in the top right user icon] -> Account -> Private Token
